## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned to work with semantic HTML5 and work with CSS.
Also, i learn about Flexbox.
At the beginning I completed the challenge without following the Mobile-first approach, but then I tried to follow that approach and I found it more flexible and easy.
Also, with this challenge I practice some of the git workflow.

### Continued development

I will focus to learn and improve my knowledge about flexbox and mobile-first workflow.
